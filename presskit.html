  <h2>Long Description</h2>
  <p>
    <h3>There's a big alien mess and somebody's gotta clean it up...</h3>

    Control the alien infested space station from the safety of your security desk in this funny, brain bending strategy game.
    Guide the station janitor, Lenny, through dangerous winding levels and solve the station's mysteries along the way.

    <h3>Use every tool at your disposal</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Control doors, weapons systems and airlocks from the comfort of your security desk</li>
      <li>Scour the video feeds for alien movement or for lost clues</li>
      <li>Pilot drones to explore the station, distract aliens and lead Lenny to safety</li>
      <li>Traverse the facility minimap; just don’t always trust it to always be accurate</li>
      <li>Attempt to mute the station AI when it starts insulting you...</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Outsmart the aliens...</h3>

    ...or just burn them to a crisp!
    Aliens can hear, see and smell Lenny; it’s your job to make sure these wily beasts don’t get too close.
    Outsmart them with trickery and distraction, outrun them with quick reactions and tactics or out...burn them with flamethrowers; it’s really up to you.

    <h3>Defeat the baddie</h3>

    Some smart guy thought it would be a good idea to upload Terminator 2 to the station’s media database.
    Unfortunately, the facility AI enjoyed the movie a bit too much and went rogue, releasing all of the alien specimens and generally causing a big mess.
    Luckily for you, Lenny the janitor is here and big messes are his speciality.
    Alien Extraction contains a fully voice acted, lighthearted narrative to take back the station and reboot the evil AI.
